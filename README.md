# Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of secure communication through the use of codes and ciphers. A
code replaces whole words with other wordsÍ¾ a cipher scrambles or replaces the letters in
words (so technically, Morse code is really Morse cipher). 

One goal of cryptography is to use a key to both encrypt readable plaintext into unreadable 
ciphertext and then decrypt it back to plaintext. The goal of cryptanalysis is to decode 
ciphers and codes without knowing their key or encryption algorithm.

Our project today is based off of the Anson Stager, cofounder of Western Union and head 
of the US Military Telegraph department. He have the Union a huge advantage over the 
Confederacy through his Route Transposition Cipher. This cipher was a combination of real 
words and code words that could be broken down in a matrix. The Route Cipher was one of the 
most successful military ciphers of all time. Let me show you why.
